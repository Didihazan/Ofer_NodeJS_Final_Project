# Ofer_NodeJS_Final_Project:
The system is an advanced shopping website that allows registered users to add and manage their toys.
Each registered user can add toys to the system by filling in details such as name, description, category, image, and price.
In addition, users can retrieve information about the toys stored in the database, including details such as name, description, category, image, and price. 
The system will support authentication and authorization, so only registered users can add and retrieve toy information. 
The website will also provide an option for advanced search and filtering for toys based on category, price, and more.
